Playground I've been working on the fundamentals of Swift.

This playground is a great way to brush up on some key concepts of the language. Original doc can be located [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/GuidedTour.html)

If anyone has any suggestions for better solutions pull requests are welcome ðŸ™‚
